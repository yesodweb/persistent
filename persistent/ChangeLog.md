# Changelog for persistent

## (Unreleased) 2.11.0.0

* Introduces a breaking change to the internal function `mkColumns`, which can now be passed a record of functions to override its default behavior. [#996](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/996)
* Added explicit `forall` notation to make most API functions play nice when using `TypeApplications`. (e.g. instead of `selectList @_ @_ @User [] []`, you can now write `selectList @User [] []`) [#1006](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1006)
* [#1060](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1060)
  * The QuasiQuoter now supports `OnDelete` and `OnUpdate` cascade options.
* [#1044](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1044)
  * Field and constraint labels generated by TH can now be customized.
  * mpsPrefixFields is deprecated in favor of using these customisation functions.
* [#1032](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1032)
  * Instance for `Natural` is removed. See `OverflowNatural` for a
    replacement and rationale on why.
* [#1063](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1063)
  * A new class member `keyFromRecordM` allows you to construct a `Key
    record` from a `record` if it was defined with `Primary`.
* [#1036](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1036):
  * The method `entityIdFromJSON` that is used to parse entities now correctly works for entities that define a custom `Primary` key.
* Fix a bug where unsafe migration error messages were being shown using `Show` prior to printing, resulting in less helpful output. [#1080](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1080)
* [#1087](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1087)
  * `RawSql` now has tuple instances up to GHC's max tuple size (62)

## 2.10.5.2

* [#1041](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1041)
  * Explicit foreign keys can now reference tables with custom sql name
  * Add qualified names to the stock classes list.

## 2.10.5.1

* [#1024](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1024)
    * Add the ability to do documentation comments in entity definition syntax. Unfortunately, TemplateHaskell cannot add documentation comments, so this can't be used to add Haddocks to entities. 
    * Add Haddock explainers for some of the supported entity syntax in `Database.Persist.Quasi`

## 2.10.5

* Add the `EntityWithPrefix` type to allow users to specify a custom prefix for raw SQL queries. [#1018](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/1018)
* Added Acquire based API to `Database.Persist.Sql` for working with
  connections/pools in monads which aren't MonadUnliftIO. [#984](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/984)

## 2.10.4

* Log exceptions when closing a connection fails. See point 1 in [yesod #1635](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/issues/1635#issuecomment-547300856). [#978](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/978)

## 2.10.3

* Added support for GHC 8.8 about MonadFail changes [#976](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/976)

## 2.10.2

* Added `runMigrationQuiet` and `runMigrationUnsafeQuiet` to `Database.Persist.Sql.Migration` as safer alternatives to `runMigrationSilent`. [#971](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/971)
  This functions as workaround/fix for: [#966](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/966), [#948](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/948), [#640](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/640), and [#474](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/474)
* Added RawSql instances for 9, 10, 11 and 12-column results. [#961](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/961)

## 2.10.1

* Added `constraint=` attribute to allow users to specify foreign reference constraint names.

## 2.10.0

* Added two type classes `OnlyOneUniqueKey` and `AtLeastOneUniqueKey`. These classes are used as constraints on functions that expect a certain amount of unique keys. They are defined automatically as part of the `persistent-template`'s generation. [#885](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/885)
* Add the `entityComments` field to the `EntityDef` datatype, and `fieldComments` fields to the `FieldDef` datatype. The QuasiQuoter does not currently know how to add documentation comments to these types, but it can be expanded later. [#865](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/865)
* Expose the `SqlReadT` and `SqlWriteT` constructors. [#887](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/887)
* Remove deprecated `Connection` type synonym. Please use `SqlBackend` instead. [#894](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/894)
* Remove deprecated `SqlPersist` type synonym. Please use `SqlPersistT` instead. [#894](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/894)
* Alter the type of `connUpsertSql` to take a list of unique definitions. This paves the way for more efficient upsert implementations. [#895](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/895)

## 2.9.2

* Add documentation for the `Migration` type and some helpers. [#860](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/860)

## 2.9.1

* Fix [#847](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/847): SQL error with `putMany` on Sqlite when Entity has no unique index.

## 2.9.0

* Added support for SQL isolation levels to via SqlBackend. [#812]
* Move `Database.Persist.Sql.Raw.QQ` to a separate `persistent-qq` package [#827](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/827)
* Fix [832](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/832): `repsertMany` now matches `mapM_ (uncurry repsert)` and is atomic for supported sql back-ends.

## 2.8.2

* Added support for `sql=` to the unique constraints quasi-quoter so that users can specify the database names of the constraints.

## 2.8.1

* DRY-ed up and exposed several util functions in `Database.Persist.Sql.Util`.
	* Upstream-ed `updatePersistValue`, `mkUpdateText`, and `commaSeparated` from `Database.Persist.MySQL`.
	* De-duplicated `updatePersistValue` from various `Database.Persist.Sql.Orphan.*` modules.
* Batching enhancements to reduce db round-trips.
	* Added `getMany` and `repsertMany` for batched `get` and `repsert`.
	* Added `putMany` with a default/slow implementation. SqlBackend's that support native UPSERT should override this for batching enhancements.
	* Updated `insertEntityMany` to replace slow looped usage with batched execution.
* See [#770](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/770)

## 2.8.0

* Switch from `MonadBaseControl` to `MonadUnliftIO`
* Reapplies [#723](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/723), which was reverted in version 2.7.3.

## 2.7.3.1

 * Improve error messages when failing to parse database results into Persistent records. [#741](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/741)
 * A handful of `fromPersistField` implementations called `error` instead of returning a `Left Text`. All of the implementations were changed to return `Left`. [#741](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/741)
 * Improve error message when a SQL insert fails with a custom primary key [#757](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/757)

## 2.7.3

* Reverts [#723](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/723), which generalized functions using the `BackendCompatible` class. These changes were an accidental breaking change.
* Recommend the `PersistDbSpecific` docs if someone gets an error about converting from `PersistDbSpecific`

## 2.7.2 [DEPRECATED ON HACKAGE]

* Many of the functions have been generalized using the `BackendCompatible` class. [#723](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/723)
	* This change was an accidental breaking change and was reverted in 2.7.3.
	* These change will be released in a future version of Persistent with a major version bump.
* Add raw sql quasi quoters [#717](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/717)

## 2.7.1
